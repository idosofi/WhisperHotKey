## Building and Testing

To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme WhisperHotkey -configuration Debug -sdk macosx build
```

This command builds the `WhisperHotkey` scheme in the `Debug` configuration for macOS.

After building, you can run the application from Xcode or directly from the build products directory.
